# Kaizen Folio 🌱

A private growth portfolio, **extra-curricular tracker** and parent dashboard for our children — art, speech, Cambridge exams, Chinese, Hindi, dance, drama, singing, writing, olympiads, sports, coding, accolades and everything in between, kept safe in one place.

*Kaizen (改善) means "change for the better" — small steps, every day. Folio is the portfolio they build along the way. Internally the code still uses the original working name, "ankur", for files, cookies and environment variables.*

## What's in the MVP

- **Private by design** — login only. Nothing is public, uploads are served only to signed-in users, pages are `noindex`.
- **Three roles** — *Parent* (add/edit everything), *Family* (view the portfolio only) and *Child* (view their own journey, with Buddy).
- **Portfolio journey** — a timeline of moments with notes, photos, voice/speech recordings, videos and PDFs, organised in tabs:
  - 📚 **Study** — Exams, Olympiads (subject, score and percentage; SASMO, SEAMO, ICAS, Math Kangaroo, SOF suggestions), Chinese, Hindi, Writing, Coding, Robotics
  - 🏅 **Sports** — Sports & games, Swimming, Gymnastics, Martial arts, Skating
  - 🎨 **Arts & stage** — Art, Dance, Singing & music, Drama & stage, Speech & debate
  - ⭐ **Awards & school** — Community (VIA), Accolades, School, Other

  Any moment can also carry a **role** — Team captain, Class monitor, Club leader, MUN delegate — tracked separately from just taking part, because that's what universities (and GIIS/MOE's own leadership tracks) actually weigh. See [docs/WHY.md](docs/WHY.md#does-this-actually-help-with-university-applications) for what that's based on.

  Each achievement can carry a level (school, zonal, national, international) and a result (medal, rank, belt).
- **Goals tab — the pathway** — Singapore's three transitions, each with what it asks for (2026 rules, with sources), her evidence so far, and the goals you set:
  - 🎒 **Primary → Secondary** — PSLE scoring and Posting Groups, plus DSA-Sec: her portfolio ranked by DSA talent area (strongest first, by count, highest level and years)
  - 🏫 **Secondary → JC / Poly** — SEC (replacing O-Levels), the new JC/poly criteria, and LEAPS (Leadership, Achievement, Participation, Service) built from her record
  - 🎓 **JC → University** — UAS and aptitude-based admission at NUS/NTU/SMU, plus what US and UK universities weigh: depth, leadership, service, exceptional talent, subject depth

  Goals can be linked to an area, so new moments in that area show up as progress by themselves.

  Below the stages, a **university explorer** — a map and 19 major universities (Singapore, UK, Europe, US) with how each admits and a link to the official page, plus what matters at each age. It's **parked until she leaves primary school** (you can still look), and she never sees it — see [docs/WHY.md](docs/WHY.md#universities--and-why-theyre-parked-until-secondary-school). The timeline uses her PSLE year (estimated from the birthday, or set in her profile).
- **PDF portfolio** — one tap builds an A4 book: cover, highlights (biggest stage first), olympiad record with best and average % per subject, levels and belts, current classes, then every moment with photos. Filter by tab and dates, then *Save as PDF*. It uses the browser's print engine, so Hindi, Chinese and emoji come out right.
- **Parent dashboard** — upcoming contests & exams, activities (Hindi tuition, art class, …) and an **exam ladder** (Cambridge pre-seeded; one-tap ladders for Mandarin YCT/HSK, ICAS and SASMO awards, SwimSafer, gymnastics, dance, drama and music grades, belts, coding and robotics; add any track).
- **Kid login + Buddy** — each child can have a view-only login (fenced to their own profile) with a friendly, tappable sprout buddy. Parents don't see it. See [docs/WHY.md](docs/WHY.md). Parents can add their own **buddy pictures** (a favourite character or toy, named by you) in the Family tab, and the child picks one by tapping Buddy → *Change my buddy*. Pictures are private family uploads, never part of this repo.
- **Learning stories, Kaizen-style** — each moment records more than the medal:
  - 💛 **Qualities shown** (curiosity, persistence, courage, creativity, kindness, teamwork, focus, bouncing back), summed up on the portfolio, the dashboard and the PDF.
  - 🌱 **Next small step** — one doable thing to try next; the dashboard lists open steps to tick off.
  - ✏️ **In her own words** — the child (or a parent, typing what she said) adds how it felt and what she wants to remember. The only text a kid login can write, and only on her own moments.
  - 💬 **Family cheers** — grandparents and parents leave short notes the child can read; parents can remove any cheer.
- **Download everything** — *Family → Download*: one ZIP with every record as JSON, the original photos and files, and an `index.html` that opens offline. No passwords or sessions are included.
- **Multi-child ready**, installable on a phone (PWA), light and Midnight themes.

### Ideas borrowed from around the world

- **Learning stories** (New Zealand's *Te Whāriki*, as used by Storypark): notice the moment, recognise the learning, respond with a next step — and include the child's voice and the family's voice.
- **Singapore MOE's holistic reporting**: report books dropped class and level positions to reduce comparison; lower-primary awards now recognise qualities like diligence and curiosity. So qualities sit next to results here.
- **Growth-mindset research** (Carol Dweck): praise effort, strategy and bouncing back rather than "being smart" — hence the cheer suggestions and the Bounced back quality.
- **Keepy**: relatives commenting on a child's work keeps the family involved — hence cheers.

## Why this exists

Capture, not generation: AI can make a PDF in a minute, but only from what was saved at the time. Read [docs/WHY.md](docs/WHY.md) for the problem, why it is deliberately *not* blockchain, honest weaknesses, and how we'll test whether it's worth keeping.

## Try it with demo data

```bash
npm install
npm run seed        # loads a fictional family (add --reset via `npm run seed:reset` to wipe data/ first)
npm start           # then open http://localhost:3000
```

| Who | Sign in with | What they see |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parent | `parent@example.com` / `ankur-demo-1` | Everything, can edit |
| Family | `grandma@example.com` / `grandma-pass1` | Portfolio, view only |
| **Kid** | tap **🧒 I’m a kid**, then `mira` / `sprout1` | Her own journey, view only, with Buddy |

Parents can also see the kid view without signing out: **Family → 👀 Preview kid view**.
The demo family is fictional — real use starts from a fresh app, where the first screen sets up your own account.

## Run it

Requires **Node 22.13+** (uses the built-in `node:sqlite`, so no native build step).

```bash
npm install
npm start            # http://localhost:3000
npm test             # API tests
```

On first visit you'll be asked to create the parent account and the first child. After that, invite family — or create the child's own login (a simple username + short password) — from **Family → Invite**.

| Env var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Port to listen on (default `3000`) |
| `ANKUR_DATA_DIR` | Where the SQLite DB and uploads live (default `./data`) |
| `COOKIE_SECURE=1` | Mark the session cookie `Secure` — **set this behind HTTPS** |
| `TRUST_PROXY=1` | Trust one reverse proxy hop (for correct client IPs behind nginx/Caddy) |
| `TZ` | The family's time zone, e.g. `TZ=Asia/Singapore`, so "today" is your day, not UTC's |

## Deploying on AWS (outline)

1. EC2 or Lightsail small instance, Node 22, put the app in `/opt/ankur`.
2. Run under systemd with `ANKUR_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/ankur`, `COOKIE_SECURE=1`, `TRUST_PROXY=1`.
3. Caddy or nginx in front for HTTPS on your domain (Let's Encrypt).
4. **Back up `ANKUR_DATA_DIR`** (DB + `uploads/`) — e.g. nightly snapshot or `aws s3 sync`. This is the only copy of the memories.

## Layout

```
server.js          Express API + static hosting
db.js              SQLite schema and helpers
demo-content.js    Fictional sample moments (flagged, removable in one tap)
public/catalog.js  THE list of areas, tabs, levels, subjects and ladder templates — shared by server and browser
public/app.js      Single-page app (vanilla JS, no build step); PWA manifest and service worker alongside
test/              API tests (node --test)
```

To add a new area, add one line to `CATS` in `public/catalog.js` and a colour in `style.css` — a test fails if you forget the colour.

## Roadmap ideas

Per-entry visibility (hide some from family), yearly highlights, reminders for upcoming events, S3 storage for media, multi-family accounts.
